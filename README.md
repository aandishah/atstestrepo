# Web Mapping Final Project Report: Weather and Twitter Trends Exploration

Research Question: How are weather trends and twitter trends related?

Authors Names: _Zexing Zheng, William Henshaw, Aandishah Tehzeeb Samara_

# Introduction

Previous studies have explored the societal-scale impact of the weather on people’s mood through their Twitter interactions _(Zimmerman et al 2017; Li et al. 2014; Hannak et al. 2012)_. Using aggregation of tweets and analyzing their patterns, researchers were able to determine that aggregate sentiment follows distinct climate, temporal, and seasonal patterns. Our objective for this final project is to create a web mapping platform that visualizes these patterns and provides real time insights to how tweets correspond to weather patterns. 
_Are positive tweets corresponding to good weather days and negative tweets corresponding to somber weather patterns?_
Through the use of Weather API, Windy API, Google Map API, and Twitter API services, we would be able to extract our necessary variables and analyze these patterns. 
Understanding the mechanism of human behavior and what they are influenced by is a crucial step to grasp how to address burning issues such as climate change and encourage positive discourse.  

Our goal is to create a website that showcases the relationship between weather and their influence on tweets, backing the claims of previous academics, through a more publicly accessible platform to give insight to the general populace. 

# Data 

For this project, we will collect and use three sets of data collected from APIs. 
First, we collected current weather from Open Weather Map (https://openweathermap.org/).
Next, we collected weather forecast data from Windy API(https://www.windy.com/).
Lastly, our twitter trends were generated from an open source Twitter Trend by Ata Özdamar (https://rapidapi.com/Lynextion/api/twitter-trend/). This twitter trend sets is currenly limited to 61 countries. 

_We hope you enjoy our website!_
